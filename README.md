# PriBOM

This repository is for the project Privacy Bills of Material. 

ðŸš€ To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to systematically summarise the privacy notice generation tools.

ðŸš€ We introduce the concept of **PriBOM** (Privacy Bills of Material) and propose a proof-of-concept implementation for mobile app development.

ðŸš€ We conduct a usability evaluation to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the design of **PriBOM**.
